# Function-Optimization-Using-PSO-and-GA
Comparison between the two very similar evolutionary algorithms : Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). Highlighting the computational procedures that each follows. Comparison is made using five CEC 2005 mathematical benchmark functions: F1(Shifted Sphere Function),F2(Shifted Schwefel’s Problem),F6(Shifted Rosenbrock’s Function), F7(Shifted Rotated Griewank’s Function) and F9(Shifted Rastrigin’s Function).
